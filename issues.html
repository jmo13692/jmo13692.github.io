		<li> <b> Climate Change: </b> There is only a small window of time when games aren't too hot or too cold, both for the players and the fans. We would like to build an indoor stadium to better accomodate our patrons and contribute to a better all-around game experience. </li>
		<li> <b> Foreign Policy: </b> In the name of competition, we do not wish to befriend other players - even if we know them from home or scouting camps. </li>
		<li> <b> Immigration: </b> We want to grow the hedges taller so that enemies can not take over our field. </li>
		<li> <b> Health Care: </b> We endorse the University Health Center as the best medical office in Athens, and we'd like to introduce ChubbCare, which provides free health insurance to all student athletes. </li>
		<li> <b> Education: </b> While we generally like to stick to the mantra "School comes first", we would like to implement a more relaxed education policy which allows generous excuses for games, practices, promo events, etc. </li>
