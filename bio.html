<p> <h2 style="color:red;"> <center> <b> Nick Chubb </b> </center> </h2> </p>
<p> 
	<h4> <center> Born in Cedartown, Georgia, Nick Chubb grew up as a star in both football and track. At the end of his high school career, he was ranked as a 4-star recruit, and he signed to the University of Georgia to play college football in June 2013. He has two siblings, Zach and Neidra Chubb. His parents, Lavelle and Henry, are very proud of their son's accomplishments. Nick enjoys long walks on the beach and a good chicken parm. His birthday is on December 27th, 1995, which he dislikes because it is so close to Christmas - he feels that this allows him less presents. He is an Athletic Training major. Nick is passionate about the legacy of UGA football and is ready to make the Dawgs great again! </center> </h4>
